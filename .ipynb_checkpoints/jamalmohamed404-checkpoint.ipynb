    "The Euclidean Algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers. It works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger one until the two numbers become equal. This final number is the gcd. However, a more efficient version of the algorithm uses division instead of subtraction. It repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller one and replaces the larger number with the remainder until the remainder is zero. The divisor at this stage is the gcd.\n",
